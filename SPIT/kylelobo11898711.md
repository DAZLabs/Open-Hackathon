# Project Name
AuthentiFi

## Description
- In today’s world, how do you know if you are buying a genuine product?
- For more than a decade now, RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) technology has been quite effective in providing anti-counterfeits measures in the supply chain.
- We leverage the idea of Bitcoin’s blockchain that anyone can check the proof of possession of balance. Along with this, we plan to use QR codes.
- We plan to implement a proof-of-concept system employing a blockchain-based decentralized application which gives a customer the entire history of a product (eg- brand info, owner, etc).

## Functions
+ Unlike a normal database, Blockchain has a non-destructive (immutable) way to track data changes over time. This means that data is not editable rather, whenever updates are made, a new block is added to the “block-chain”. This helps track historical data (authenticity and owner data) of a product.
+ Transparent nature of the Blockchain helps avoid [parallel trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_import).
+ Using Blockchain, authenticity can be checked and ownership of a product can be transferred _decades_ from now; even if the product is discontinued.
+ Full visibilty of the supply and post supply chain
+ Change of ownership of products 
+ Anti-theft reporting

+ JavaScript - Scripting Language for web pages
+ Bootstrap - Templating

## Limitations
+ The user needs to have a QR code scanner / smart phone in order to check the product information.
+ Products that have already been manufactured prior to today cannot be tracked.
+ We currently depend on the company to register with our services, without which, we cannot provide information about a brand to the user.

## Future Aspects
+ To track every genuine product that is to be sold.
+ Implement this idea in other fields.
+ Implement our own tokens which can be sold to users so that they can purchase ownership of a product using tokens which helps in insurance processing.
