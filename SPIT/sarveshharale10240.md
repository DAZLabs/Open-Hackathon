# Block Grains - Monitoring diversions in PDS outlets 

## Description
This project aims to increase the traceability of diversions occuring in PDS(Public Distribution System) outlets or Ration Shops. It aims to deploy all the data regarding the PDS supply chain on the blockchain so that it serves as a reliable source of data regarding

- Prices of different commodities as prescribed by the government
- Amount of food grains distributed to each PDS outlet
- Amount of food grains entitled to beneficiaries according to their ration card type
- Amount of food grains purchased by the beneficiaries
By deploying all the data on the blockchain, the PDS outlet dealer has no power of diverging food grains to open market or overpricing the commodities to the beneficiaries.

- Languagues Used: Python, Javascript, Java, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Truffle, Web3
- Frameworks: Flask
- Libraries: pyotp, socket, mysqlalchemy, pymysql, session, 
 
 with their need & purpose

## Limitations

- This project does not cover the whole PDS supply chain but can be extended to cover the same.
- There already exists a database containing beneficiary data with his/her fingerprint information. (For real life implementation, the
Aadhaar database can be used)

- System need Internet connectivity to connect with the blockchain
network and transacting in real time

## Future Aspects

- This system can be extended to cover the whole PDS(Public Distribution System) supply chain i.e. from procurement from farmers
to consumption by beneficiaries thereby increasing transparency and accountability in the whole system.
- Online payments can be introduced
